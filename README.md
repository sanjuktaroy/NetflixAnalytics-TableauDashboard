# Netflix Analytics Dashboard
This project showcases a dashboard created for Netflix analytics using Tableau. It is an interactive dashboard which can display details of the selected movie or TV series according to the user input. It also visualizes basic information about the general data and its distribution. 

Sample results have been attached in the form of images in this repository, with examples for multiple movies and TV series.
